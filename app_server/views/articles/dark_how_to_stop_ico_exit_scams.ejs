						<h3 class="blog-title"><a href="">How do we stop ICO exit-scams? Is regulation the answer? Probably, but not as we expect.</a></h3>
						<p>In my earlier article I established that there was a clear difference in the terminology between coins and tokens. Although the terms may mean the same thing in the physical world, the terms have parted ways to mean separate things in the digital world. See my definition <a href="/owners/blog/icos_arent_dead_stos_not_a_replacement">here</a>. Just to re-iterate, although the title mentions ICOs, I actually mean any crypto-asset offerings (not just coins that run on an underlying infrastructure). So for the sake of a better term, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunoschneider/">Bruno Schneider</a> commented on my earlier article with ‘Tokenised business offering’ which I think is a very good umbrella term for all of the above, so thank you Bruno for the suggestion!</p>
						<p>From now on in this article, I’ll refer to them as TBOs, however, this does not include ALL offerings, since the buzzword at the tail-end of 2018 is ‘STOs’, I am going to exclude them from this term as they offer something the others do not — centralised regulation. So when I mention TBOs in this article — I actually mean ‘Un-regulated Tokenised business offerings’ which includes coin offerings and utility token offerings.</p>
						<br />
						<h4>Lets get on with it...</h4>
						<p>I could use this article to point out several reasons as to why TBOs are seen to be ‘dying’ or to some… ‘already dead’. In my opinion, there’s lots of reasons why, but one of the biggest reasons for me is that the investment model most TBOs adopt, actually incentivises founders to run off with the money raised, causing what’s known as ‘exit-scams’.</p>
						<br />
						<h4>In an ideal world</h4>
						<p>To understand this, lets first go through the traditional investment model for TBOs. A business has come up with a brilliant idea on how they can (genuinely) revolutionise their industry by adopting a tokenised infrastructure. This business then estimates that they would need $10 million to create absolutely everything they’ll need to run this business. Lots of budding investors buy tokens until the business finally reaches their hard cap of $10 million. The business is then trusted to take this $10 million and build the business they dreamed of, making themselves into a functioning, billion dollar company and making all of their investors rich.</p>
						<br />
						<h4>Who wouldn’t be tempted?</h4>
						<p>However, the problem here is, how many people can genuinely admit that if they were given $10 million and asked to run a business — oh, and it’s relatively easy to keep it for yourself and move to Barbados –would take the long and painful road of starting a company when they’ve just technically made themselves a millionaire?</p>
						<p>This model creates an incentive (or at the very least, a massive temptation) to run off with the money, creating another exit scam and leaving investors without any return on their investment.</p>
						<br />
						<h4>Why STOs have gained so much popularity</h4>
						<p>So STOs as they say on the tin, ‘offer security tokens’ to investors. Security tokens represent a ‘external, tradeable asset’ which includes (but is not limited to) shares of the company. Due to STOs crossing the SECs border on what’s classed as a security, they now apply to regulations in the US and must comply with the federal laws surrounding them. This means STO projects make it much more difficult to create an exit-scam, without facing the consequences.</p>
						<p>NOTE: this does not mean that STOs themselves are more secure, this does not mean that STOs are a better model of investment than the other TBOs in the list, it just means that due to them crossing this line, they are now regulated by a centralised authority. If the SEC was to take the same look on utility tokens, then the rest of the TBOs would be just as secure as STOs would be, as the creators of those tokens would be equally accountable for running away with the investments.</p>
						<br />
						<h4>So… lets just regulate everything under a central authority? Yes? No.</h4>
						<p>This means the ‘security of your investment’ comes from regulation. So the answer is surely, let’s just regulate all TBOs regardless of what investment model they offer? Well yes, but not in a way we may expect.</p>
						<p>Centralised regulation creates a bottle neck to innovation, it creates laws that may not benefit every project and introduces costs that most start-ups simply can’t afford in order to comply with these laws. More importantly, centralised systems are not the crypto-way.</p>
						<p>We need to create a self-regulating model of investment, so that businesses and investors can work together to increase the confidence in the market and reduce the risk of exit-scams! Here is my call to innovators out there, please let me know what ideas you have had on how we can self-regulate projects as a community in the comments below!</p>
						<br />
						<h4>Heres my two cents at what investment models should look like.</h4>
						<p>For me, a ‘milestone model’ on TBO investment would be the best way to go.</p>
						<p>The business in this case must create a roadmap of milestones they aim to reach and theestimated funding they would need to reach each of them. The business would then run an initial offering to raise all of this funding. (I.e. let’s say the business needs $10 million to achieve every milestone, but only initially needs $50k to reach their first milestone, $100k for the second one, $1m for the third one etc). This would allow investors to unlock their investments to the company in stages, on the condition that they are meeting the milestones on their roadmap.</p>
						<p>So, the first $50k is unlocked to the business and they go off and try to reach their first milestone. Following this, they would then issue a notification to their investors to come and experience their first milestone in action. Investors can now see the progress the company has made themselves and have the choice to unlock further investment, or remove themselves from the project by selling their tokens back to the businesses offering.</p>
						<p>If the business successfully reaches that milestone, then the investors will most likely want to continue with the investment and vote to unlock the next lot money to reach the next milestone ($100k or 1% of total investment).</p>
						<p>If the business does not reach the milestone, then chances are most (if not all) investors would return their tokens and collect 99.5% of their original investment, keeping 0.5% of worthless tokens.</p>
						<p>If the project gets to a certain milestone and decides to change direction, adjusting their roadmap and their estimations to create something new, then 50% of the investors may stick with the company, and 50% may not. This forces the business to find investors who believe in their change in direction enough to ‘buy into’ the project and buy the rest of the tokens that were returned by the non-believers. Ensuring the business must have enough traction to set off on their new goals.</p>
						<p>I must add a note here to say, the tokens that investors do not return to the business must be in proportion to the investment the company has already spent. If the company reaches a certain milestone using 50% of the total investment, then investors should return 50% of their tokens for the remaining 50% of their investment back. If the company then goes on to sell the tokens that were returned to other investors, raise the investment needed and becomes successful, the original investor still benefits (all be it, not as much) from their initial investment into the idea, as they have kept 50% of the tokens that they rightfully deserve for pushing the company on that far.</p>
						<p>This brings a range of benefits:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>This allows the community to regulate the companies and prevent exit-scams occurring on such a large scale.</li>
							<li>Investors now have a chance to re-coup a large sum of their investments if the business does not look competent enough to reach their milestones.</li>
							<li>If a business decides to change its milestones and/or company goals, investors have an opportunity to opt out, meaning businesses must find genuine interest in their next goal, in order to raise investment and carry on achieving their aims.</li>
							<li>Businesses have an incentive to go off and reach the milestones that they set out.</li>
							<li>Businesses also have an incentive to start off small and work their way up, gradually testing each hypothesis out such that they safely grow into a sustainable business model followed by a large group of early adopters.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Obviously, this is just an idea and it probably won’t be the best one out there, but my point is that we need systems in place that allow communities to self-regulate these companies instead of waiting around for the powers that be to do it for us.</p>
						<br />
						<h4>TL;DR</h4>
						<p>Security tokens bring the benefit of being regulated by a centralised authority, meaning businesses that adopt this model are accountable for their actions if they decide to run away with the investment.</p>
						<p>Non-regulated offerings do not have this same accountability and therefore, have an incentive to run away with the investment that they collect. In order to overcome this, we need to self-regulate these projects as a community. I have suggested a ‘milestone model’ of investment which gives insight into how we can achieve this.</p>
